The size of the file is about the same idicating that FLAC levl 4 is not much better than level 2.

The following is an example of what doesn't work.
Here the adc read cycle is longer than the adc buffer duration, so the buffers will overflow.
This is caused by dsetting the FLAC comp level to 4 and running the cpu clock at 250MHz.
