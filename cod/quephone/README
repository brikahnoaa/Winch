Hi Brian,
I put the two versions of QUEphone programs in \\BIOAC3\matsumot.
1) Provor_BasedQUEphone is a CF2 based program developed for the 
original Provor float QUEphone.  Alex's code is based on this. It is 
very old written around 2006.
2)The second one is under APEX_basedQUEphone. It is more recent one and 
the original code was written by Dana Swift, Univ. of Washington. He 
wrote it for the APEX float of WEBB Teledyne which was for CTD work. The 
data are  sent over satellite modem (not Rudics) using the same A3LA. I 
changed the data communication codes to adopt the PMEL Rudics login, 
file upload, command procedures and to communicate with WISPR board. You 
can find what I did in apf9main.c. Apex based code is more complicated. 
Because Apex does not have data storage, it splits one large file in RAM 
into 20 kB files, send them one by one. After successful file 
transmission, it erases all files to save memory space.

where did code in upload come from?
