PWRSuspendSecs works, but serial is funky after. 
Console requires output a char and delay 2ms to get output normal.

.2 cpu speed
  RS232 Examples/RS232-LP-BigBuf.c
  16000 -- ?
TMGSetSpeed(SYSCLK);
  SYSCLK  choose: 3680, 7360, 14720 for best RS-232
  1840 is too slow for output
    CSSetSysAccessSpeeds(nsFlashStd, nsRAMStd, nsCFStd, WTMODE);


.1 cpu speed
serial works at 3640 but console falls apart below that down to 480
between 460 and 160 serial works well, but rtc is unstable, fails
sometimes clock fails right away, sometimes after a while
