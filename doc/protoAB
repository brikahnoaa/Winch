 == commands can be abbreviated to one letter, followed by \n
 == data mode continuously queries TempDepth and computes velocity
 == in data mode, td responds immediately (with last data)
 == in idle mode, td has 2sec delay 
 == all responses end with ok\n or err[0-9]\n

v3
^A - ^F as v2, ^G as v4 (partial)

v2
Serial interface program to control and 
 communicate with SBE and Iridium/GPS.
Buoy is connected to com4 at 9600 BAUD
 ^A Antenna G|I 
 ^B Binary byte 
 ^C Connect I|S 
 ^D powerDown I|S
 ^E binary lEngth
 ^F binary 2bytes (TBD)
 ^G unused

v1.0
 * SwitchAntenna
 * Switch antenna module between SBE39 TD, Iridium and GPS.
 * send ^b to connect SB39.Type 'ts' to get the T-D from SB39plus.
 * send ^f to connect GPS. Antenna SW is GPS side.
 * send ^d to connect Iridium/GPS. Antenna to IRID side.
 * send ^e to exit.
