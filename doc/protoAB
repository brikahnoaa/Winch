^A - ^F as v2, ^G as v4 (partial)

v2
Serial interface program to control and 
 communicate with SBE and Iridium/GPS.
Buoy is connected to com4 at 9600 BAUD
 ^A Antenna G|I 
 ^B Binary byte 
 ^C Connect I|S 
 ^D powerDown I|S

v1.0
 * SwitchAntenna
 * Switch antenna module between SBE39 TD, Iridium and GPS.
 * send ^b to connect SB39.Type 'ts' to get the T-D from SB39plus.
 * send ^f to connect GPS. Antenna SW is GPS side.
 * send ^d to connect Iridium/GPS. Antenna to IRID side.
 * send ^e to exit.
