.1 If the buoy rises in current, the winch may not detect slack at surface
.. watch antenna module depth while surfacing, call STOP
.2 If the buoy rises in current, then later reduced current or wave action over some minutes may allow the buoy to surface next to ant mod
.. watch buoy depth after antmod surfacing and FALL if needed to avoid surface
.3 If the buoy reaches surface, the line may be too slack to start winch
.. see .2, and also patiently retry FALL if not descending
.. don't trust winch to notify STOP if not descending due to slack, test this
.4 At surface, ant mod depth varied by half the wave depth
.. don't trust antMoving() function within 4 meters of surface (a setting)
.5 Some winch behavior does not compute
.. winch tests
... winch behavior if slack before or during FALL
... if winch stops during FALL, does it retry later?
... winch maximum pull kg
... winch actual surface slack
... possible false slack indications if tension varies or if tilted
