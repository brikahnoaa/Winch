v errors to fix
v. data cycle, to only go up once a day
v. write file, send file - lost ability
. verify
v. output log\s16.log log\s39.log
v. datetime for 16+32
v. boy.reset
v. boy.stop
v. config file
. improvements this april
v. humid, press, battery - and turn off after using
-. stay down command (X cycles), count down in syslog
v. save data from 16+32 rise and fall
v. process land commands
v. syslog disk space wspr
v. more info in eng report
v.. temp, ocean curr at dock; cycles
v.. gps drift, surf depth
v.. detections, storm, restart
v.. up bgn/end, down bgn/end
x.. voltage, current, humid, press
.. robust winch commands (resend, detect)
v. set gain, gps time every data cycle (daily)
. test cycle
-. change wispr gain remote (g2 => crash?)
.. change spectra gain
. planned, if we have time 
..0 on start move sys.log to syslog\date\time.log
..1 in case of failure to create files, execute reboot
v.2 collect data from sbe16 and sbe39 both during descent
..3 special test - at 10m. go up, stop, do measurements, come back down
v.4 spectrogram only before rise, not every shutdown
..5 automatic timeout on surface, detected by winch params not buoy code
..6 calendar - season to stay down
..7 more than 1 block per file
..8 englog: land commands
..9 if at surf but no stop, then stopCmd

from haru:
CF2 program to work on (3/1/2019)
1. Send command from shore
a. Pre-amp gain (CF2 to WISPR)
b. Change of rise time
c. Cancelling the rises for the following multiple days
i. How many days? (1-250 days, e.g., sea ice season)
d. Change the % of duty cycle.
2. Send data from the buoy
a. CF2 stores the WISPR detections and attach a file for data transmission
b. Battery voltage
c. Free data space of WISPR
d. Run the “spectrogram8kHz” before rise. Send the wind speed and noise level.
e. Measure the tilt angle of mooring from the two CTDs.
f. Stored SBE16 data of previous falling
g. Stored SBE39 data while rising
3. Keep data transmission size under 10 kB per rise.
a. If the buoy stays for many days (e.g., 180 days), there are a lot files to send. What is
the good strategy to catch up the file transmission? Send multiple files per rise? If so,
in what order (e.g., old -&gt;new or new-old?)

one hour, then check current against rise hour; repeat
... storm check (get tougher each day)

. run out line through entire call phase
. gather data for extended line, antMod depth with brake on
. GPS time -> cf2 -> wispr
