1. At the beginning of noise*.log file from 0 to 8, for a few days dates
were 3/30/2019. Times were different. Could be GPS time reading errors,
but why it fixed the time later?
2. Noise008.log is very large. Seems it concatenated to a one file. This
is the period when LARA stayed at depth for the storm to pass.
2. It seems missing the acoustic wind data of the time just before LARA
rises.  For example, there are date between 07:30 and 08:30, and no data
near 08:00.
3. Starting time of noise*.log gradually becomes later as the dive/fall
cycles progresses. Does it mean that the winch fall speed got slower?
4. noise34.log did not end with the acoustic wind speed.

v errors to fix
v. data cycle, to only go up once a day
v. write file, send file - lost ability
. verify
v. output log\s16.log log\s39.log
v. datetime for 16+32
v. boy.reset
v. boy.stop
v. config file
. improvements this april
v. humid, press, battery - and turn off after using
v. stay down command (X cycles), count down in syslog
v. save data from 16+32 rise and fall
v. process land commands
v. syslog disk space wspr
v. more info in eng report
v.. temp, ocean curr at dock; cycles
v.. gps drift, surf depth
v.. detections, storm, restart
v.. up bgn/end, down bgn/end
x.. voltage, current, humid, press
v. robust winch commands (resend, detect)
v. set gain, gps time every data cycle (daily)
. test cycle
v. change wispr gain remote (g2 => crash?)
v. change spectra gain
.. iridAuton
. planned, if we have time 
v.0 on start move sys.log to syslog\date\time.log
..1 in case of failure to create files, execute reboot
v.2 collect data from sbe16 and sbe39 both during descent
..3 special test - at 10m. go up, stop, do measurements, come back down
v.4 spectrogram only before rise, not every shutdown
..5 automatic timeout on surface, detected by winch params not buoy code
..6 calendar - season to stay down
..7 more than 1 block per file
..8 englog: land commands
v.9 if rise phase_tmr, then stopCmd

from haru:
CF2 program to work on (3/1/2019)
1. Send command from shore
a. Pre-amp gain (CF2 to WISPR)
b. Change of rise time
c. Cancelling the rises for the following multiple days
i. How many days? (1-250 days, e.g., sea ice season)
d. Change the % of duty cycle.
2. Send data from the buoy
a. CF2 stores the WISPR detections and attach a file for data transmission
b. Battery voltage
c. Free data space of WISPR
d. Run the “spectrogram8kHz” before rise. Send the wind speed and noise level.
e. Measure the tilt angle of mooring from the two CTDs.
f. Stored SBE16 data of previous falling
g. Stored SBE39 data while rising
3. Keep data transmission size under 10 kB per rise.
a. If the buoy stays for many days (e.g., 180 days), there are a lot files to send. What is
the good strategy to catch up the file transmission? Send multiple files per rise? If so,
in what order (e.g., old -&gt;new or new-old?)
