alex: winch blast of nulls
alex: power .8A
alex: batt cap current, new

vee - 7.5K, each set uses more space, erase to free space but limited
v check free space sometimes

when ctd times out, bizarro depth numbers

at surface, never gives up on gps fail (e.g. no antenna)

x in GPSIRID, never checks for console input

v at start, turn ant off, defaults on
v recovery mode after failed irid calls

v shut down at phase 4 for 12v or lower
v duty cycle = half time


descend phase 4: motor stop before dock, no stop command, goes to phase 1

power: 0.804A, whassup with this?
write ctd data
create_dtx_file() c:00000208.dtx opened
should cf2 be setting date on ctd?

ctd: output is crlf, doubled on pulse
ctd: power off doesn't take ctd out of sleep mode. ctd never turns off. batt?
ctd: batt fail mode - reset bench config?
x ctd: input must be cr\r terminated, w/o lf\n
x ctd: ! remove \n in output to ctd

x what is line terminator to/from winch in winch.c?

what are all the appendfiles / moves at startupt

what is this about?
Updates from ADS.c version 2.0
   -Working to make file open more efficient.
   -Received many errno=0 when fopen return NULL. No idea why. waiting to hear
