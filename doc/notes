looking at cflow.rev, only call into Settings.c is PreRun call to Settings
do not need Settings.c

---

alex: winch blast of nulls
alex: power .8A
alex: batt cap current, new

when ctd times out, bizarro depth numbers

at surface, never gives up on gps fail (e.g. no antenna)

in GPSIRID, never checks for console input

descend phase 4: motor stop before dock, no stop command, goes to phase 1

power: 0.804A, whassup with this?
write ctd data
create_dtx_file() c:00000208.dtx opened
should cf2 be setting date on ctd?
1680x1050 weird.

ctd: output is crlf, doubled on pulse
ctd: power off doesn't take ctd out of sleep mode. ctd never turns off. batt?
ctd: batt fail mode - reset bench config?
x ctd: input must be cr\r terminated, w/o lf\n
x ctd: ! remove \n in output to ctd

x what is line terminator to/from winch in winch.c?

what are all the appendfiles / moves at startupt

what is this about?
Updates from ADS.c version 2.0
   -Working to make file open more efficient.
   -Received many errno=0 when fopen return NULL. No idea why. waiting to hear
