compare s16 vs s39

.1 #define EXEC "S>" V "<Executed/>"
.2 no s39.pumpmode
.3 TSSON - same?
.4 power
s16 mpc pulse WISPR_PWR_ON (37) WISPR_PWR_OFF (42)
s39 umpc toggle SBEPWR (23)
.5 old format
sbe39 has a new format, look at appendix III pg 72. Use legacy=y?
s39 txRealTime=n to avoid # at start of data
"When TxRealTime=Y, real-time autonomous data and real-time serial
line sync data transmitted to the computer is preceded by a # sign"
