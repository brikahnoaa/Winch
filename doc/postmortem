.1 how to test
.. hint - number of cycles ~= 20?
... what happens in a cycle
... test 40 cycles of gps, wispr, rise/fall with ctd
.. identify fail mode
... first cannot create files, then cannot open Hello to read ?
... are data files being created?
.. if this is similar to last deploy fail mode
... what is the same, different?
.2 protection, sanity checks
.. send hello from string, to max ability for commands
.. read/write static file, should always work
.. limits on err types (dangerous, settable)
.. watchdog
.3 external to cf2: wispr, cf card, boy2ant
.4 other weak spots
.. timing; delays to let external ops complete
... file open, block, block, close
.. serial buffering
... wispr stack trace that occurs during interactions
... enumerate interactions
.5 wispr hardening
.. eliminate serial input
.. limit async actions (e.g. parameter for announcing detections)
