init:
  number of starts > startsMax?
  if normal (not testing) then deploy else jump to startPhase (i.e. rise)

deploy:
  turn on antenna module, check depth every minute until >10m
  wait until we are steady
  turn off ant mod
  wait 5 minutes
  record depth
  test all wispr boards
  skip wispr data acq, but read wind noise / storm detect
  risePhase

first cycle:
  same as regular cycle, except
    record velocity for first rise to halfway, first drop from 2 meters to dock
    send stats but no data

regular cycle:
  data:: every hour: % duty cycle wispr data acq, storm detect, off
  rise:: at selected hour: check ocean current? rise halfway, current? surface
  call:: compile stats, data; transfer to antmod; call home; time limit
  drop:: turn off ant, on sbe16; descend, read and store ctd data

always:
  after any winch command: if no response in 16 sec and no motion then repeat cmd
  check for keyboard input (i.e. on test bench)

notes: 
  TBD - sleep MPC during WISPR duty cycle
