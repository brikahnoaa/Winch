riseRun - if no signal, check depth, rise?
 - after call phase, stop cable for 1min and record

boy.minute to go double speed in tests
after riseRun, stop and depth for one or two minutes

depth between calls
gps drift and depth test; before and after, plus 2m after riserun

emu: rise 00 response
emu: winch command fail sometimes
emu: start logging from ctd

fix: retry riseFree()

errs in dry test

emu switch no surf detect; echo cable len for up/down cmd

buoystatus end test

after test, go normal?

riseRun v rise(-1,0) ?

safe stop (auton)
