riseRun - if no signal, check depth, rise?
 - after call phase, stop cable for 1min and record

v boy.minute to go double speed in tests
v after riseRun, stop and depth for one or two minutes

x depth between calls - no, auton is on
gps drift and depth test; before and after, plus 2m after riserun

emu: rise 00 response
emu: winch command fail sometimes
emu: start logging from ctd

fix: retry riseFree()

errs in dry test

emu switch no surf detect; echo cable len for up/down cmd

buoystatus end test

after test, go normal?

riseRun v rise(-1,0) ?

safe stop (auton)
