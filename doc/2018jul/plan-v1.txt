.1 obj: irid call, drift and depth measure
.1.1 irid - place multiple calls, increase size on success
... run out line during calls. if #S and buoy not surfaced, then #R.
... full descend for audio tests between irid tests
... time limit 5 minutes
... use 1K files
.1.2 drift and depth - is it necessary to run line during irid call?
... measure gps every 30s, depthA when not gps, depthB continuous.
... surface, brake, test 2min
... let out 20m or slack (surf+20). brake, test. 2min
... let out +20m or slack (surf+40). brake, test. 2min
... let out +20m or slack (surf+60). brake, test. 2min
... let out +20m or slack (surf+80). brake, test. 2min
... down without gps, with depth
.2 procedure
.. test both ctd, gps, irid at start time. sbe39 failure is fatal
.. 4 cycles - three for irid, one for drift test
.. acoustics: 1 minute of detection recording, wind test
.. buoy status:
  binary depth 8 bits; 4bits ??, 2bits phase, 2bits cycle
